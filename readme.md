# How to install

1. Copy honnypotter.php into a new directory in ``$WP_ROOT/wp-content/plugins/``
2. Activate via administration panel.
3. All failed login attempts will be logged to ``$WP_ROOT/wp-content/plugins/$PLUGIN_FOLDER/log.txt``

# Note(!!!)

This will currently make all failed login attempts globally accessible. Use at your own risk. Clear the logs immediately if you for some reason type in your wrong (but almost correct) password. This might change in a future version.
